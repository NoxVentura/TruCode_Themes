**_True Colors_** is a colorful programming skinline for Visual Studio Code, based on League of Legends' **True Damage** skinline! Created by yours truly. These are my first themes, so make sure to let me know if you see something off or out of place, or even don't work well, and I'll try to fix it.

The themes are designed with [**_Theme Studio_**](https://themes.vscode.one/), which I recommend you try out for yourself if you're sane enough to create your own theme then have it previewed in real time.

The colors are adapted from [**_Electron_**](https://github.com/kcmr/electron-theme-vscode), augmented by other colors from popular themes, as well as [**_Coolors_**](coolors.co) and [**_Color Hunt_**](colorhunt.com).

Supports most languages, including, but not limited to: CSS, JS, TypeScript, HTML, PHP, Ruby, YAML, Markdown, Python, Ruby, Java, C#, Scala and more.

The colors are mostly based on the Electron/One Dark Pro/Material Themes, plus more colors sourced from. This was once my personal theme so there're a lot of colors in there.

### Recommended Settings

The theme is designed to work with the
