```js
const damage: boolean = true;
```

A colorful skinline for Visual Studio Code, based on the legendary **True Damage** skinline from **League of Legends**! Supports most languages, including, but not limited to: CSS, JS, TypeScript, HTML, PHP, Ruby, YAML, Markdown, Python, Ruby, Java, C#, Scala and more.

The colors are mostly based on the Electron/One Dark Pro/Material Themes, plus more colors sourced from [Coolors](coolors.co) and [Color Hunt](colorhunt.com). This was once my personal theme so there're a lot of colors in there.

These are my first themes, so make sure to let me know if you see something off or out of place, or even don't work well, and I'll try to find time to fix it.
