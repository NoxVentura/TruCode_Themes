# [INIZIO]

A new theme I made for myself... just starting out on GitHub so this theme would mark the _beginning_ of it.

The theme comes from TasnimulHasan007's [Valorant](https://github.com/TasnimulHasan007/valorant-theme) theme, and the colors are all from me, and based around the [Electron](https://github.com/kcmr/electron-theme-vscode) VSCode theme by Kus Camara.

I'll be maintaining this when I have the time, so stick up as soon as I get the rest of it finished. I'll be making a light version of the theme very soon.

This theme is best used with [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) at **500 weight**.

## Screenshots (coming soon)
