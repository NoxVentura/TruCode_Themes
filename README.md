# INIZIO

A new theme I made for myself... just starting out on GitHub so this theme would mark the _beginning_ of it. 

The theme comes from TasnimulHasan007's [Valorant](https://github.com/TasnimulHasan007/valorant-theme) theme, and the colors are all from me, and based around the [Electron](https://github.com/kcmr/electron-theme-vscode) VSCode theme by Kus Camara. 

Will be maintaining this as I have time, thanks for your understanding!
